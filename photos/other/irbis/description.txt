One day, not day, it was already a night, I walked past this gas station and saw that it's fucking dark no lights at all. It was so unusial, because it was working 24/7 as long as I lived in this neighbourhood. I don't know why they decided to rebuild it because it looked fine to me, hope it will look cooler.
